  <h1 class="title topictitle1">Using Procedural Languages</h1>

  <div class="body">
    <p class="p">HAWQ allows user-defined functions to be written in other languages besides SQL and C. These
      other languages are generically called <em class="ph i">procedural languages</em>(PLs). For a function
      written in a procedural language, the database server has no built-in knowledge about how to
      interpret the function's source text. Instead, the task is passed to a special handler that
      knows the details of the language. The handler could either do all the work of parsing, syntax
      analysis, execution, etc. itself, or it could serve as "glue" between HAWQ and an existing
      implementation of a programming language. The handler itself is a C language function compiled
      into a shared object and loaded on demand, just like any other C function.</p>

    <p class="p">There are currently three procedural languages available in the HAWQ distribution:</p>

    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="li">PL/pgSQL</li>


      <li class="li">PL/R</li>


      <li class="li">PL/Java</li>

    <h2 class="title topictitle2">Using PL/pgSQL</h2>

    <div class="body">
      <p class="p">SQL is the language of most other relational databases use as query language. It is
        portable and easy to learn. But every SQL statement must be executed individually by the
        database server. PL/pgSQL is a loadable procedural language:</p>

      <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li"> creates functions and trigger procedures </li>


        <li class="li"> adds control structures to theSQLlanguage </li>


        <li class="li"> performs complex computations </li>


        <li class="li"> inherits all user-defined types, functions, and operators </li>


        <li class="li"> is trusted by the server </li>

      </ul>

      <p class="p">You can use functions created with PL/pgSQLwith any database that supports built-in
        functions. For example, it is possible to create complex conditional computation functions
        and later use them to define operators or use them in index expressions.</p>

      <p class="p">Every SQLstatement must be executed individually by the database server. Your client
        application must send each query to the database server, wait for it to be processed,
        receive and process the results, do some computation, then send further queries to the
        server. This requires interprocess communication and incurs network overhead if your client
        is on a different machine than the database server.</p>

      <p class="p">With PL/pgSQL, you can group a block of computation and a series of queries inside the
        database server, thus having the power of a procedural language and the ease of use of SQL,
        but with considerable savings of client/server communication overhead.</p>

      <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li"> Extra round trips between client and server are eliminated </li>


        <li class="li"> Intermediate results that the client does not need do not have to be marshaled or
          transferred between server and client </li>


        <li class="li"> Multiple rounds of query parsing can be avoided </li>

      </ul>

      <p class="p">This can result in a considerable performance increase as compared to an application that
        does not use stored functions.</p>

      <p class="p">PL/pgSQL supports all the data types, operators, and functions of SQL.</p>

  <div class="topic nested1" id="supportedargumentandresultdatatypes">
    <h2 class="title topictitle2">Supported Argument and Result Data Types</h2>

    <div class="body">
      <p class="p">Functions written in PL/pgSQL accept as arguments any scalar or array data type supported
        by the server, and they can return a result containing this data type. They can also accept
        or return any composite type (row type) specified by name. It is also possible to declare a
        PL/pgSQL function as returning record, which means that the result is a row type whose
        columns are determined by specification in the calling query. See <a class="xref" href="#tablefunctions">Table Functions</a>.</p>

      <p class="p">PL/pgSQL functions can be declared to accept a variable number of arguments by using the
        VARIADIC marker. This works exactly the same way as for SQL functions. See <a class="xref" href="#sqlfunctionswithvariablenumbersofarguments">SQL Functions with Variable Numbers of
          Arguments</a>.</p>

      <p class="p">PL/pgSQLfunctions can also be declared to accept and return the polymorphic
        typesanyelement,anyarray,anynonarray, andanyenum. The actual data types handled by a
        polymorphic function can vary from call to call, as discussed in <a class="xref" href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/extend-type-system.html#EXTEND-TYPES-POLYMORPHIC" target="_blank">Section 34.2.5</a>. An example is shown in <a class="xref" href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/plpgsql-declarations.html#PLPGSQL-DECLARATION-ALIASES" target="_blank">Section 38.3.1</a>.</p>

      <p class="p">PL/pgSQL functions can also be declared to return a "set" (or table) of any data type that
        can be returned as a single instance. Such a function generates its output by executing
        RETURN NEXT for each desired element of the result set, or by using RETURN QUERY to output
        the result of evaluating a query.</p>

      <p class="p">Finally, a PL/pgSQL function can be declared to returnvoidif it has no useful return
        value.</p>

      <p class="p">PL/pgSQL functions can also be declared with output parameters in place of an explicit
        specification of the return type. This does not add any fundamental capability to the
        language, but it is often convenient, especially for returning multiple values. The RETURNS
        TABLE notation can also be used in place of RETURNS SETOF .</p>

      <p class="p">This topics describes the following PL/pgSQLconcepts:</p>

        <li class="li">Table Functions</li>

  <div class="topic nested1" id="tablefunctions">
    <h2 class="title topictitle2">Table Functions</h2>

    <div class="body">
      <p class="p">Table functions are functions that produce a set of rows, made up of either base data types
        (scalar types) or composite data types (table rows). They are used like a table, view, or
        subquery in the FROM clause of a query. Columns returned by table functions can be included
        in SELECT, JOIN, or WHERE clauses in the same manner as a table, view, or subquery
        column.</p>

      <p class="p">If a table function returns a base data type, the single result column name matches the
        function name. If the function returns a composite type, the result columns get the same
        names as the individual attributes of the type.</p>

      <p class="p">A table function can be aliased in the FROM clause, but it also can be left unaliased. If a
        function is used in the FROM clause with no alias, the function name is used as the
        resulting table name.</p>

      <p class="p">Some examples:</p>

      <pre class="pre codeblock">CREATE TABLE foo (fooid int, foosubid int, fooname text);

CREATE FUNCTION getfoo(int) RETURNS SETOF foo AS $$
    SELECT * FROM foo WHERE fooid = $1;
$$ LANGUAGE SQL;

SELECT * FROM getfoo(1) AS t1;

SELECT * FROM foo
    WHERE foosubid IN (
                        SELECT foosubid
                        FROM getfoo(foo.fooid) z
                        WHERE z.fooid = foo.fooid
                      );

CREATE VIEW vw_getfoo AS SELECT * FROM getfoo(1);

SELECT * FROM vw_getfoo;
</pre>

      <p class="p">In some cases, it is useful to define table functions that can return different column sets
        depending on how they are invoked. To support this, the table function can be declared as
        returning the pseudotype record. When such a function is used in a query, the expected row
        structure must be specified in the query itself, so that the system can know how to parse
        and plan the query. Consider this example:</p>

      <pre class="pre codeblock">SELECT *
    FROM dblink('dbname=mydb', 'SELECT proname, prosrc FROM pg_proc')
      AS t1(proname name, prosrc text)
    WHERE proname LIKE 'bytea%';</pre>

      <p class="p">The<samp class="ph codeph">dblink</samp> function executes a remote query
          (see<samp class="ph codeph">contrib/dblink</samp>). It is declared to return <samp class="ph codeph">record</samp>
        since it might be used for any kind of query. The actual column set must be specified in the
        calling query so that the parser knows, for example, what <samp class="ph codeph">*</samp> should expand
        to.</p>

    </div>

  </div>

  <div class="topic nested1" id="sqlfunctionswithvariablenumbersofarguments">
    <h2 class="title topictitle2">SQL Functions with Variable Numbers of Arguments</h2>

    <div class="body">
      <p class="p">SQL functions can be declared to accept variable numbers of arguments, so long as all the
        "optional" arguments are of the same data type. The optional arguments will be passed to the
        function as an array. The function is declared by marking the last parameter as VARIADIC;
        this parameter must be declared as being of an array type. For example:</p>

      <pre class="pre codeblock">CREATE FUNCTION mleast(VARIADIC numeric[]) RETURNS numeric AS $$
    SELECT min($1[i]) FROM generate_subscripts($1, 1) g(i);
$$ LANGUAGE SQL;

SELECT mleast(10, -1, 5, 4.4);
 mleast 
--------
     -1
(1 row)</pre>

      <p class="p">Effectively, all the actual arguments at or beyond the VARIADIC position are gathered up
        into a one-dimensional array, as if you had written</p>

      <pre class="pre codeblock">SELECT mleast(ARRAY[10, -1, 5, 4.4]);    -- doesn't work</pre>

      <p class="p">You can't actually write that, though; or at least, it will not match this function
        definition. A parameter marked VARIADIC matches one or more occurrences of its element type,
        not of its own type.</p>

      <p class="p">Sometimes it is useful to be able to pass an already-constructed array to a variadic
        function; this is particularly handy when one variadic function wants to pass on its array
        parameter to another one. You can do that by specifying VARIADIC in the call:</p>

      <pre class="pre codeblock">SELECT mleast(VARIADIC ARRAY[10, -1, 5, 4.4]);</pre>

      <p class="p">This prevents expansion of the function's variadic parameter into its element type, thereby
        allowing the array argument value to match normally. VARIADIC can only be attached to the
        last actual argument of a function call.</p>

    </div>

  </div>

  <div class="topic nested1" id="polymorphictypes">
    <h2 class="title topictitle2">Polymorphic Types</h2>

    <div class="body">
      <p class="p"> Four pseudo-types of special interest are anyelement,anyarray, anynonarray, andanyenum,
        which are collectively called <em class="ph i">polymorphic types</em>. Any function declared using these
        types is said to be a<em class="ph i">polymorphic function</em>. A polymorphic function can operate on many
        different data types, with the specific data type(s) being determined by the data types
        actually passed to it in a particular call.</p>

      <p class="p">Polymorphic arguments and results are tied to each other and are resolved to a specific
        data type when a query calling a polymorphic function is parsed. Each position (either
        argument or return value) declared as anyelement is allowed to have any specific actual data
        type, but in any given call they must all be the sam eactual type. Each position declared as
        anyarray can have any array data type, but similarly they must all be the same type. If
        there are positions declared anyarray and others declared anyelement, the actual array type
        in the anyarray positions must be an array whose elements are the same type appearing in the
        anyelement positions.anynonarray is treated exactly the same as anyelement, but adds the
        additional constraint that the actual type must not be an array type. anyenum is treated
        exactly the same as anyelement, but adds the additional constraint that the actual type must
        be an enum type.</p>

      <p class="p">Thus, when more than one argument position is declared with a polymorphic type, the net
        effect is that only certain combinations of actual argument types are allowed. For example,
        a function declared as equal(anyelement, anyelement) will take any two input values, so long
        as they are of the same data type.</p>

      <p class="p">When the return value of a function is declared as a polymorphic type, there must be at
        least one argument position that is also polymorphic, and the actual data type supplied as
        the argument determines the actual result type for that call. For example, if there were not
        already an array subscripting mechanism, one could define a function that implements
        subscripting <samp class="ph codeph">assubscript(anyarray, integer)</samp> returns
          <samp class="ph codeph">anyelement</samp>. This declaration constrains the actual first argument to be
        an array type, and allows the parser to infer the correct result type from the actual first
        argument's type. Another example is that a function declared <samp class="ph codeph">asf(anyarray)</samp>
        returns <samp class="ph codeph">anyenumwill</samp> only accept arrays of <samp class="ph codeph">enum</samp> types.</p>

      <p class="p">Note that <samp class="ph codeph">anynonarray</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">anyenum</samp> do not represent
        separate type variables; they are the same type as <samp class="ph codeph">anyelement</samp>, just with an
        additional constraint. For example, declaring a function as <samp class="ph codeph">f(anyelement,
          anyenum)</samp> is equivalent to declaring it as <samp class="ph codeph">f(anyenum, anyenum)</samp>;
        both actual arguments have to be the same enum type.</p>

      <p class="p">Variadic functions described in <a class="xref" href="#sqlfunctionswithvariablenumbersofarguments">SQL Functions with Variable Numbers of Arguments</a>can be polymorphic: this is
        accomplished by declaring its last parameter as <samp class="ph codeph">VARIADICanyarray</samp>. For
        purposes of argument matching and determining the actual result type, such a function
        behaves the same as if you had written the appropriate number of
          <samp class="ph codeph">anynonarray</samp> parameters.</p>
